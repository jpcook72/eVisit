We like to provide a little coding challenge for all engineering candidates at eVisit. This helps us learn how you approach problems. Besides, it’s fun!
 
Due Date: May 6th 
 
Please let us know if this schedule doesn't work for you, and we can accommodate.
 
The challenge:
 
Imagine your team has developed a web service, and you want to keep track of the IP addresses that are making the most requests to your service each day. Your job is to write a program that (1) tracks these IP addresses in memory, and (2) returns the top100 most common IP addresses.
 
In the language of your choice, please implement these functions:
 
request_handled(ip_address)
This function accepts a string containing an IP address like “145.87.2.109”. This function will be called by the web service every time it handles a request. The calling code is outside the scope of this project. Since it is being called very often, this function needs to have a fast runtime.

top100()
This function should return the top 100 IP addresses by request count, with the highest traffic IP address first. This function also needs to have a fast runtime. Imagine it needs to provide a quick response to display on a dashboard, even with 10s of millions of IP addresses.

clear()
Called at the start of each day to forget about all IP addresses and tallies.
 
Please provide a written description of your approach that explains:
 
What would you do differently if you had more time?
What is the runtime complexity of each function?
How does your code work?
What other approaches did you decide not to pursue?
How would you test this?
 
Notes:
 
We won’t be compiling or running your code, so the syntax doesn’t have to be perfect.
Any language is fine. Don’t worry about using a language that has a good or bad reputation for performance.
Assume this web service gets tens of millions of requests each day.
If your language requires it, you are welcome to implement these functions as class methods (e.g., Java) or as functions in a module (e.g., Python).
Feel free to use idiomatic style for your language of choice, such as camelCase or snake_case, including changing the names of the functions and parameters above.
 
Your code will be assessed for:
 
Coding style: Is the code easy to read? Are the names clear?
Data structure choice: Did you choose data structures that are conducive to solving the problem?
Speed: Does the code run optimally fast with tens of millions of unique IP addresses?
Documentation: Is the writing clear?
 
We suggest providing your submission as a link to a git repository. However, an attachment (tar/zip) in response to this email would also be just fine.
 
Thank you! We look forward to your submission!
